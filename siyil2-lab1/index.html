    <h2>Hi, my name is Florence!</h2>

    <p id="intro">Originally from Shenzhen, China, I moved to New York when 
        I was 14. Now, I’m a senior at Carnegie Mellon University 
        studying Business and Statistics, where I’ve discovered my 
        love for unraveling the stories behind 
        numbers, especially in finance and the fast-paced world of secondary 
        markets. Last summer, I got to live that passion firsthand as a 
        Sales & Trading Analyst at Citi in New York, 
        where I learned to navigate markets, build client relationships, 
        and thrive under pressure.

        But life isn’t all about spreadsheets and stock tickers. 
        I’m a firm believer in the magic of human connection. 
        Whether it’s bonding with strangers over street food in Bangkok or 
        hiking with friends in the Swiss Alps, I’ve carried my curiosity 
        to 25+ countries (and counting!). 
        Traveling has taught me to adapt, listen, and find common ground skills 
        I bring to every project and conversation.
  
        This website is a peek into my journey. Thanks for stopping by, 
        and feel free to reach out.</p>
